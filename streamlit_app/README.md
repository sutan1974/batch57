## Model Information

- **Algorithm**: RandomForest Classifier
- **Performance**: F2-Score 0.789, Recall 100%, Precision 68%
- **Features**: 22 features (including 5 engineered features)
- **Threshold**: 0.31 (optimized for F2-Score)

### Engineered Features
1. `target_gap`: Difference between target and actual achievement
2. `overwork_ratio`: Overtime to regular hours ratio
3. `tenure_per_age`: Company loyalty indicator
4. `income_per_hour`: Compensation efficiency
5. `experience_to_tenure`: Experience vs company tenure ratio

## Risk Categories

- **Loyal** (probability < 0.31): Low churn risk
- **At Risk** (0.31 ‚â§ probability < 0.60): Medium churn risk
- **Potential Churn** (probability ‚â• 0.60): High churn risk

## Recommendations Engine

The system provides personalized recommendations based on:
- Risk level and probability
- Top contributing factors
- Business rules and best practices
- Priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
